Homework Assignment - NY Times articles display
Review the filter and sort array methods on mdn and in this readme.

use filter to remove articles that do not have the exact section name (i.e. for books only display those with  "section": "books",) before they are displayed on the page
sort the articles by title before they are displayed on the page
sign up to NYTimes developer, create an app and use your own api key
(optional) use a button in the UI to run the sort and filter
You should probably work inside the setLocalStorage function but feel free to arrange things as you see fit
